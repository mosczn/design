{{< lead >}}

## The Challenge

L.M. Personnel Services relied on a patchwork of tools, manual processes, and disconnected interfaces to manage recruitment and internal communication. Staff struggled with:

- Tracking candidates in different systems  
- Communicating between branches and teams  
- Managing onboarding with fragmented documentation  
- Using an outdated UI that felt clunky and slow

The assignment was to design a **unified platform** that made recruitment management efficient, clear, and cohesive — without overwhelming users with change.

---

## My Role

I was responsible for the full UX/UI process from research to final design. This included:

- Understanding current workflows and pain points with staff interviews  
- Designing wireframes and interactive prototypes  
- Iterating on usability feedback  
- Delivering final UI and design system components

My focus was on removing friction from everyday tasks — not just adding polished screens.

---

## Research & Insights

I started by talking with recruiters, HR staff, and administrators to understand where the existing system was failing them. The conversations revealed:

- Information was scattered across tools and notifications  
- Users often repeated work because they couldn’t see what others had done  
- Simple actions (like messaging or checking candidate status) took too many clicks

These insights shaped the design priorities: **clarity, consistency, and flow efficiency**.

## Design & Process

### Unified Dashboard

The first priority was creating a central place where users could see key recruitment metrics, active candidates, and notifications at a glance. This reduced time spent switching between tools.

### Message & Notification System

Recruiters needed smoother internal communication. I designed messaging and notifications that were integrated into the workflow, reducing reliance on email or external tools.

### Consolidated Candidate & User Management

I created screens where staff could easily track candidates, roles, and onboarding kits in one place, improving visibility and reducing duplication of effort.

### Dark Mode & Visual Modernization

At the client’s request, I introduced a sleek dark mode design that not only modernized the UI but also improved focus and reduced visual fatigue during long hours of use.

## The Solution

The final platform brought every major recruitment function into a cohesive experience:

- **Real-time dashboard** for recruitment activities  
- **Integrated messaging and notifications** to improve communication  
- **Central candidate and worker lists** for streamlined tracking  
- **User management and roles** for permission control  
- **Onboarding kit management** to standardize new-hire processes

Each feature was designed to cut down repetitive steps and surface the right information at the right time.

---

## The Result

The redesigned system delivered noticeable improvements:

- Recruitment workflows became faster and more predictable  
- Communication between staff and branches improved dramatically  
- Onboarding became more organized with less manual effort  
- Staff reported a more pleasant and usable system thanks to the modern UI

Even without hard analytics, user feedback made it clear: people were completing tasks with *less frustration and more confidence*.

---

## Reflection

This project reinforced for me that the best UX isn’t flashy — it’s **functional**. When a platform helps people do their jobs instead of working around it, the impact is unmistakable.

In future iterations, I’d like to introduce usability metrics and A/B testing to quantify improvements further, and potentially explore responsive or mobile interactions for on-the-go recruiters.
